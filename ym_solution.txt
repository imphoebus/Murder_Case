# Walk-through from Y.M.
First of all, search for "CLUE" within the file Crimescene (grep 'CLUE' crimescene)
And the result is as follows:
CLUE: Footage from an ATM security camera is blurry but shows that the perpetrator is a tall male, at least 6'.
CLUE: Found a wallet believed to belong to the killer: no ID, just loose change, and membership cards for AAA, Delta SkyMiles, the local library, and the Museum of Bash History. The cards are totally untraceable and have no name, for some reason.
CLUE: Questioned the barista at the local coffee shop. He said a woman left right before they heard the shots. The name on her latte was Annabel, she had blond spiky hair and a New Zealand accent.

Second, we need to find the female witness named Annabel (see CLUE 3). So search for 'Annabel' within the file people (grep 'Annabel' people)
Result:
Annabel Sun	F	26	Hart Place, line 40
Oluwasegun Annabel	M	37	Mattapan Street, line 173
Annabel Church	F	38	Buckingham Place, line 179
Annabel Fuglsang	M	40	Haley Street, line 176

Third, we know that the Annabel we want is a female, so discard the info about the two males. Then we go to the specific line in each street file for further clues.
Annabel Sun: sed -n '40'p ./streets/Hart_Place
Result: SEE INTERVIEW #47246024

Annabel Church: sed -n '179'p ./streets/Buckingham_Place
Result: SEE INTERVIEW #699607

Fourth, we go to the two interview files and see what they say.
Annabel Sun: cat interview-47246024
Result: Ms. Sun has brown hair and is not from New Zealand.  Not the witness from the cafe.

Annabel Church: cat interview-699607
Result: Interviewed Ms. Church at 2:04 pm.  Witness stated that she did not see anyone she could identify as the shooter, that she ran away as soon as the shots were fired.
        However, she reports seeing the car that fled the scene.  Describes it as a blue Honda, with a license plate that starts with "L337" and ends with "9"

Fifth, we search the file vehicles for 'L337*9', 'Honda' and 'Blue'. (grep -A 5 'L337' vehicles | grep -A 3 'Honda' | grep -A 2 'Blue’). Note: -A 5 means print this line and the five lines after.
Result:

Color: Blue
Owner: Erika Owens
Height: 6'5"
--
Color: Blue
Owner: Aron Pilhofer
Height: 5'3"
--
Color: Blue
Owner: Heather Billings
Height: 5'2"
--
Color: Blue
Owner: Joe Germuska
Height: 6'2"
--
Color: Blue
Owner: Jeremy Bowers
Height: 6'1"
--
Color: Blue
Owner: Jacqui Maher
Height: 6'2"

Sixth, we eliminate the ones below 6 feet, which gives ‘Erika Owens’, ‘Joe Germuska’, ‘Jeremy Bowers’ and ‘Jacqui Maher’. We then search for each of the four in the file people  
grep "Erika Owens" people 
Erika Owens	F	56	Trapelo Street, line 98

grep "Jacqui" people 
Jacqui Maher	F	40	Andover Road, line 224

grep "Jeremy" people 
Jeremy Bowers	M	34	Dunstable Road, line 284

grep "Joe Germuska” people 
Joe Germuska	M	65	Plainfield Street, line 275

Seventh, take the names of the two males in the above list and search in the folder memberships (-R to search recursively within a directory)
grep -R "Jeremy Bowers" ./memberships/
./memberships//AAA:Jeremy Bowers
./memberships//Delta_SkyMiles:Jeremy Bowers
./memberships//Museum_of_Bash_History:Jeremy Bowers
./memberships//Terminal_City_Library:Jeremy Bowers

grep -R "Joe Germuska" ./memberships/
./memberships//AAA:Joe Germuska
./memberships//Terminal_City_Library:Joe Germuska

Finally, remember that in the second CLUE, AAA, Delta, Museum and Library membership card were found therefore we can conclude that JEREMY BOWERS is the murderer. <checked>
